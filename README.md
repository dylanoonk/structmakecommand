# StructMake Command
Saves minecraft builds to JSON files

to build simply run `./gradlew.bat build` for Windows or `./gradlew build` for anyone who's not a loser.

This adds a new command to Minecraft which allows you to save a build in an easy-to-read JSON format. I did this so i can use it with CC:Tweaked but you can do you. 

Sytax:
`/structmake <x1> <y1> <z1> <x2> <y2> <z2>`
It will save on your desktop (specifically C:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Desktop/)
